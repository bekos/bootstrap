A lightweight & flexible pagination directive that is focused on ... providing pagination!

It will take care of visualising a pagination bar. Additionally it will make sure that the state (enabled / disabled) of the Previous / Next and First / Last buttons (if exist) is maintained correctly.

It also provides optional attributes max-size and rotate to limit the size of pagination bar and whether to keep current page in the middle of the visible ones.

There is also a pager directive with just previous and next links for simple pagination implementations.
